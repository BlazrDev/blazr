# blazr

Blazr is an open source 2D game engine with the goal of eventually being able to create complex 2D games with complex mechanics and features. In the future, our goal is to expand it to 3D as well.

## Building

For now, you can build and test the engine on Windows using Visual Studio by simply opening the Blazr.sln file.

If you are on Linux, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chameleeon/blazr.git
cd blazr
premake5 gmake
make
```

To run the Sandbox application, type:
```bash
./bin/Debug-linux-64/Sandbox/Sandbox
```
